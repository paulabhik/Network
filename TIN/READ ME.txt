1. To change the command line argument go to Project - > TIN Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Debugging -> Command Arguments

2. Current the command line arguments are
top14 NSFNET_100 routing forwarding path distance 0
That is optimistic connection and distance metric is used

top14 --> default topology file
NSFNET_100 --> default connection file
path --> All the connections admitted are stored
forwarding --> Label forarding base table is stored
routing --> First and Second shortest disjoint path is stored for every node pair
p = 0 --> optimistic
p = 1 --> pessimistic
hop_or_distance = distance --> distance metric used
hop_or_distance = hop--> hop count metric used

3. All the input and output files are present inside the TIN Folder
